##  A quick look;
South America doesn’t get much more evocative of generations gone by than Peru. Its mix of ancient civilizations and unparalleled archaeology, set among some of the most extraordinary views on the planet, means few destinations have as much to offer visitors as Peru. The old Inca citadel of Machu Picchu, the archeological site of the Americas, is just the poster-child, it is of course magnificent, but is just one of many highlights Peru has on display. From the heights of the Rainbow Mountain to the depths of the Amazon Rainforest; cruising the clear, deep waters of Lake Titicaca and flying over the mysterious Nazca Lines or visiting sleepy colonial villages and thriving cosmopolitan cities; Peru can rival with any world-class destination.

A narrow strip of land squeezed in between the Pacific Ocean and the Andes Mountains, 4,300km (2,672mi) long and only 350km (217mi) wide at its widest point, Chile is truly a unique character. The mountains cut the country off from Argentina and Bolivia to the east, while the massive Atacama Desert separates it from Peru to the north. And to the south, beyond the snow capped peaks of the beautiful Torres del Paine National Park in Patagonia, lies nothing but ocean and Antarctica.

Tiny in size for South American standards. Due to its size Ecuador is probably the only country on the continent where in a single day you could take an early morning safari in the Amazon, drive the heart of the Andes Mountains of the country, past lush cloud forest all the way down to the Pacific coast in time for a seafood dinner. Apart from the beauty the Ecuadorian mainland holds, Ecuador also controls the Galapagos Islands, a wildlife-rich archipelago in the Pacific Ocean, the origin of Darwin’s theory of evolution. These unique islands are home to the giant tortoises, whale sharks, sea lions and many more species, several of them only to be found on the Galapagos.

##  A quick look;
From the jungle calls of the Amazon to the thong-clad crowds of Copacabana beach, Brazil is an intoxicating mix of the big, the bold and the beautiful, perennially one of the world’s favorite destinations. It’s also one of the largest countries on the planet, with an awesome array of treasures to match. Its vast coastline is fringed with soft sands and island getaways; the Amazon Basin teems with an unrivalled mass of flora and fauna; and the wetlands of the Pantanal, the largest on Earth, support a staggering diversity of wildlife. And then there’s the Iguaçu Falls, an unforgettable natural spectacle featuring hundreds of waterfalls, which cascade from the tropical rainforest as blue morphed butterflies flit through the spray. Undoubtedly the greatest draw, however, are the Brazilians themselves; probably the most hedonistic people on earth. Whether it’s Rio’s effervescent Cariocas going overboard at Carnival, or São Paulo’s sultry citizens gyrating in chic nightclubs, Brazilians love having fun.

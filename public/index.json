[{"categories":null,"contents":" For those a little familiar with the world of wines Chile and Argentina have been long time players on the international wine market. In many European supermarkets you can find Chilean wines at better prices than their European competitors and the international wine market only keeps growing. In size the Argentinean producers are close to their Chilean counterparts and these wines can also easily be found in most supermarkets or liquor stores. After this some may have heard about Pisco the typical Peruvian brandy made out of white grapes or Cachaza, the sugar cane liquor from Brazil but this will be as far as most people’s knowledge about drinks coming from South America will go (I know what you are thinking but\u0026hellip;no, tequila comes from Mexico).\nOther popular local South American Spirits include Aguardiente in Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador, a liquor based on anis \u0026amp; sugar cane; Guarape in the Amazon Basin made from fermented fruits and of course chicha de jora in the Andean Highlands, beer made from fermented corn and sugar. It must be noted that most South American spirits with the exception of Pisco are based on the native sugar cane for its fermentation and hence alcohol levels.\nThe royal juice of grapes was only introduced in the Americas during the bloody years of the Spanish conquest around the 1550’s, supposedly with the first vines arriving to Mexico being called “the common black grape” or Muscatel. From here the fame of grapes and its luxury product expanded alongside the territory conquered by the Spanish and it did not take long before the first local wines were produced. In these years these could only be consumed by the conquistadors and spanish royals. When the Spanish Crown decided that wine had to be imported from the motherland, Peru, by then a large producer of grapes, suffered from huge overproduction allowing the excess in grapes to be used to create Peru’s national brandy; Pisco. The name refers to the same region on the Peruvian South Coast. In the following years, Peru became so focussed on the production of Pisco that wine production almost came to a complete hold. This allowed bodegas in Chile, who used to produce a lot of sweet wines but under the influence of French immigrants, bringing along new productions processes and innovations, to capitalize on this change in focus from their neighbors and become the main regional player for wines in centuries to come.\nThe main wine regions in South America are focussed around three areas; Central Chile, the arid plains, valleys and mountain slopes between the Pacific Ocean and the Andes. Central Argentina; on the rolling Andean mountain plains surrounding the Mendoza Region on the other side of the Chilean Wine Valleys and finally on the Peruvian South Coast. The arid Desert around Pisco and Ica, bordered on one side by the Pacific and the other the Andes Mountains. Most South American wines are based on the Bordeaux winemaking and after dumping the more sweet Muscatel grape in favor for the more sophisticated french grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec and Sauvignon Blanc experienced a huge boom in production and sales of these South American wines. Some grapes such as the famous Chilean Carmenere originated in France but are nowadays almost exclusively grown in Chile and Argentina to some extent.\nArgentina Wine Trip Recommendations;  Familia Zuccardi; Cabernet Sauvignon, Caladoc, Malbec, Chardonnay, Ancellotta, Tempranillo and Syrah Colome; Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Chardonnay, and Syrah Bodegas Salentein; Portillo, Killka, and Salentein Trapiche; Cabernet Sauvignon, Caladoc, Malbec, Chardonnay, Ancellotta, Tempranillo and Syrah  Chile Wine Trip Recommendations;  Almaviva winery; symbiosis between Viña Concha y Toro of Chile and Baron Philippe de Rothschild of France Viu Manent; located in the Colchagua Valley; Carmenère, Petit Verdot and Malbec Kingston Vineyards; Casablanca Valley; in a valley known for its whites, they pioneered red wines, and are now selling them across the world.

Its mix of ancient civilizations and unparalleled archaeology, set among some of the most extraordinary views on the planet, means few destinations have as much to offer visitors as Peru. The old Inca citadel of Machu Picchu, the archeological site of the Americas, is just the poster-child, it is of course magnificent, but is just one of many highlights Peru has on display. From the heights of the Rainbow Mountain to the depths of the Amazon Rainforest; cruising the clear, deep waters of Lake Titicaca and flying over the mysterious Nazca Lines or visiting sleepy colonial villages and thriving cosmopolitan cities; Peru can rival with any world-class destination.\nChile Top destinations;  Santiago Atacama Desert Patagonia Torres del Paine Wine Valley \u0026amp; Lake Region  Weather; Variety of climates (Hot Desert to Sub Polar)\nInterests; Outdoors, Andean Deserts \u0026amp; Wine\nA quick look; A narrow strip of land squeezed in between the Pacific Ocean and the Andes Mountains, 4,300km (2,672mi) long and only 350km (217mi) wide at its widest point, Chile is truly a unique character. The mountains cut the country off from Argentina and Bolivia to the east, while the massive Atacama Desert separates it from Peru to the north. And to the south, beyond the snow capped peaks of the beautiful Torres del Paine National Park in Patagonia, lies nothing but ocean and Antarctica.\nBolivia Top destinations; La Paz Uyuni Salt Flats Lake Titicaca Siloli Desert Sucre \u0026amp; Potosi\nWeather; Variety of climates (Cold Desert to Subtropical)\nInterests; Andean Culture, Unique Landscapes \u0026amp; Adventure\nA quick look; Located in the heart of South America, Bolivia is a country of extremes largely still a hidden gem to the average traveler. Nowadays Bolivia has gradually opened up to a more general crowd of adventure seekers and showcasing its many amazing destinations. Edged on the verge of the Andean Highland Plateau and the deep Amazon Rainforest the country offers a very extreme geography that translates itself in strong local traditions and cultures. The country also boosts the highest number of indigenous population in South America making that the country has a specific energy that can only be found in Bolivia. The highest cities in the world, the largest Salt Flats on the planet, the largest wetlands on the continent, the highest navigable lake in the world and the world most dangerous road…the extremes don’t stop when describing Bolivia.\nArgentina Top destinations;  Buenos Aires Patagonia Iguazu Falls Perito Moreno Ushuaia Mendoza Wine Valley \u0026amp; Bariloche  Weather; Variety of climates (Arid Cold Desert to Subtropical)\nInterests; Outdoors, Waterfalls \u0026amp; Culture\nA quick look; This vast land is perhaps best known for its sensual Tango, tasty wines, phenomenal meat and world class football but there is so much more behind this magnificent country. Ranging from tropical forests in the north all the way to the tip of the South American continent at Ushuaia this giant offers a plentiful of activities and destinations for each type of traveler; Cultural and cosmopolitan Buenos Aires, the thundering Iguazu Falls, the vineyards around Mendoza or the ultimate outdoors paradise called Patagonia in the far South.\nEcuador and the Galapagos Islands Top destinations;  Quito Cuenca Cotopaxi \u0026amp; Galapagos Islands  Weather; Variety of climates (Arid, Temperate \u0026amp; Tropical)\nInterests; Andean Outdoors \u0026amp; Culture, Unique Wildlife \u0026amp; Diversity\nA quick look; Tiny in size for South American standards. Due to its size Ecuador is probably the only country on the continent where in a single day you could take an early morning safari in the Amazon, drive the heart of the Andes Mountains of the country, past lush cloud forest all the way down to the Pacific coast in time for a seafood dinner. Apart from the beauty the Ecuadorian mainland holds, Ecuador also controls the Galapagos Islands, a wildlife-rich archipelago in the Pacific Ocean, the origin of Darwin’s theory of evolution. These unique islands are home to the giant tortoises, whale sharks, sea lions and many more species, several of them only to be found on the Galapagos.\nBrazil Top destinations;  Rio de Janeiro Sao Paulo Iguazu Falls Salvador de Bahia \u0026amp; Amazon River  Weather; Variety of climates (Hot Desert to Tropical)\nInterests; Beaches, Carnival, Culture \u0026amp; Wildlife\nA quick look; From the jungle calls of the Amazon to the thong-clad crowds of Copacabana beach, Brazil is an intoxicating mix of the big, the bold and the beautiful, perennially one of the world’s favorite destinations. It’s also one of the largest countries on the planet, with an awesome array of treasures to match. Its vast coastline is fringed with soft sands and island getaways; the Amazon Basin teems with an unrivalled mass of flora and fauna; and the wetlands of the Pantanal, the largest on Earth, support a staggering diversity of wildlife. And then there’s the Iguaçu Falls, an unforgettable natural spectacle featuring hundreds of waterfalls, which cascade from the tropical rainforest as blue morphed butterflies flit through the spray. Undoubtedly the greatest draw, however, are the Brazilians themselves; probably the most hedonistic people on earth. Whether it’s Rio’s effervescent Cariocas going overboard at Carnival, or São Paulo’s sultry citizens gyrating in chic nightclubs, Brazilians love having fun.\n","permalink":"https://satosouthamerica.com/blog/where-in-south-america-should-i-go/","tags":["Chile"],"title":"Where in South America Should I Go"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Welcome to SATO South America.
